A short memorable code to share location

A Tripcode is 10 character code that describes a location on the Earth using a format that is easily read, shared, and remembered.  The format consists of unambigous numbers and letters from the English alphabet broken up with two hyphens to create something simliar to a phone number. 

For example, the Tripcode *NLN-FLS-5HRT* encodes the geospatial location of the Pyramids of Giza.  Using a relatively simple algorithm that can easily be translated to an equally simple and fast implementation in just about any popular programming language for use on any platform, a Tripcode can be created for anywhere on Earth that can also be described using latitude and longitude. 

Tripcodes retain the specificity of geospatial coordinates described with latitude and longitude while being much more easy to use e.g. a location in a public space, such as a county or state park.  A street address can get you to the front gate of the park, but a Tripcode can help you find someone somewhere within the park.

Tripcode is available as under GNU public license, and is implemented in a number of languages already. Additional implementations are welcome
